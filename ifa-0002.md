Introduction
------------
This document extends the Domain Names specification, IFA-0001. It specifies additional item types which are not DNS mappable at the time of writing. Currently, these types are used to express endpoints for various darknet technologies.

Non-DNS Item Types
------------------

  - "tor": Used to specify zero or more Tor hidden service addresses.
    
    The value for this item SHALL be one of the following forms:

    - An empty array. This denotes that hidden service connectivity is not available via the current object. This is the default semantic if the "tor" item type is not present.

    - An array of one or more strings. Each such string SHALL contain a Tor onion address, including the ".onion" suffix. (Note that the value MUST NOT be an URL.) The string MUST NOT have a trailing dot.
      
      This form denotes that the current object is mappable to any of the Tor hidden services with the given addresses. Client implementations should select an address in a similar fashion to the selection of IP addresses; sort the addresses randomly and try them in order until all addresses are exhausted.

    - A string. Where this form is encountered, it SHALL be substituted with an array containing that string and be processed as though that was what was encountered, as per the above form.

    Examples:

        "tor": []                                                    // No hidden service available
        "tor": "qaneqo4kcreewkvq.onion"                              // One hidden service available
        "tor": ["xo920axk34lannrw.onion"]                            // One hidden service available
        "tor": ["ganeqo4kcreewkvq.onion", "xo920axk34lannrw.onion"]  // Two hidden services available

    The following example forms are NOT valid:

        "tor": "ganeqo4kcreewkvq"
        "tor": "ganeqo4kcreewkvq.onion."
        "tor": "http://ganeqo4kcreewkvq.onion"
        "tor": {}

  - "i2p": Used to specify zero or more I2P eepsite addresses.
    
    The value for this item SHALL be one of the following forms:

    - An empty array. This denotes that I2P eepsite connectivity is not available via the current object. This is the default semantic if the "i2p" item type is not present.

    - An array of one or more strings. Each such string SHALL contain a base32-form I2P eepsite address, including the ".b32.i2p" suffix. (Note that the value MUST NOT be an URL.) The string MUST NOT have a trailing dot.

      This form denotes that the current object is mappable to any of the I2P eepsites with the given addresses. Client implementations should select an address in a similar fashion to the selection of IP addresses; sort the addresses randomly and try them in order until all addresses are exhausted.

      The address MUST be of the base32 form and MUST NOT be a friendly name like "example.i2p".

    - A string. Where this form is encountered, it SHALL be substituted with an array containing that string and be processed as thoug that was what was encountered, as per the above form.

    Examples:

        "i2p": []    // No eepsite available
        "i2p": "vbcc75tfgauz5qc6tlggfduudeva755sncjyuv5sfjhy7o2ltuqq.b32.i2p"   // One eepsite available
        "i2p": ["vbcc75tfgauz5qc6tlggfduudeva755sncjyuv5sfjhy7o2ltuqq.b32.i2p"] // One eepsite available
        "i2p": ["vbcc75tfgauz5qc6tlggfduudeva755sncjyuv5sfjhy7o2ltuqq.b32.i2p",
                "idphjncvywzvcjur2zeep2a44s5dxduzv7iytgihg7vdx3x5hnkq.b32.i2p"] // Two eepsites available

    The following example forms are NOT valid:

        "i2p": "vbcc75tfgauz5qc6tlggfduudeva755sncjyuv5sfjhy7o2ltuqq"
        "i2p": "example.i2p"
        "i2p": "vbcc75tfgauz5qc6tlggfduudeva755sncjyuv5sfjhy7o2ltuqq.b32.i2p."
        "i2p": "http://vbcc75tfgauz5qc6tlggfduudeva755sncjyuv5sfjhy7o2ltuqq.b32.i2p"
        "i2p": {}

  - "freenet": Provides a Freenet freesite key.

    The value for this item SHALL take the form of a string containing a Freenet freesite key, e.g. "USK@0I8g...xbZ4,AQACAAE/Example/42/".

Changes to Processing Rules
---------------------------

There are no changes to item suppression or other processing rules.

Newly Deprecated Item Types
---------------------------

The following item types are deprecated by this document and SHOULD NOT be used.

  - "i2p": The format proposed previously does not appear to make sense and includes extraneous fields. Since no actual implementations of that format are known, it has been deprecated in favour of a format more uniform with the "tor" item type.
