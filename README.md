IFA RFCs
========
People wishing to submit RFCs, first should propose their idea to the relevant communities and then to the IFA [mailing list][list]. After discussion, they should fork this repository, create a new RFC, and open an issue ticket.  After editors have checked the document for copy-editing ensured that the proper procedures were followed, they will assign a number and initiate a PR that includes the document and an updated TOC on the README.md. 

Only RFCs listed as Active are accepted standards.  Acceptance is dependent upon rough consensus and running code.
