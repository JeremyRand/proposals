IFA RFCs
========
People wishing to submit RFCs, first should propose their idea to the relevant communities and open a pull request as outlined in [RFC Guidelines & Process][0000].  After editors have checked the document for copy-editing and sanity checks, they will accept the PR.

Discussion should take the form of Gitub issue tickets whenever possible and should reference the RFC or specific pull requests to help ensure that all discussion is captured.  

Only RFCs listed as Active are accepted standards.  Acceptance is dependent upon rough consensus and running code.
