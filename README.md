IFA RFCs
========
People wishing to submit RFCs should first should propose their idea to the relevant communities and then submit a new RFC as outlined in the [RFC Guidelines & Process][0000].

Discussion relevant to the draft should take the form of Gitub issue tickets whenever possible. Github tickets should reference the RFC and/or pull requests to help ensure that all discussion is captured.  

*Note: this ToC does not list RFCs that have been deferred, rejected, or withdrawn.*
